## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to change HTML attributes in Javascript. Doing that, I realized that ViteJS change the name of the images (assets) if they are not included in a Public folder (https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) so I was needed to put them in that folder in order to be able to reference that files in Javscript's set-attribute command.

```js
shareButtonSocial.addEventListener("click", (ev) => {
  if (bannerDisplayed) {
    shareBanner.classList.replace("flex", "hidden");
    bannerDisplayed = false;
    shareButtonCard.classList.replace(
      "bg-desaturatedDarkBlue",
      "bg-lightGrayishBlue"
    );
    shareButtonCardImg.setAttribute("src", "images/icon-share.svg");
  }
});

```
### Continued development

Future projects will be developed using TailwindCSS and vanilla Javascript when interactivity must be included.
